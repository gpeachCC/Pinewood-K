Forum for parents for social event planning.
  (1) General social events with high candence and as they come up for general situational awareness
  (2) Specific bi-monthly (TBD if higher frequency is preferred) social events as a group
  (3) Other social event topics of interest
  
  
  Projects:
  (1) allows for conversational awarness for milestones we want to achieve as a group related to social activities
  
  Issues:
  (1) essentially a chat / discussion forum to enable active discussion of any thoughts related to social activity and or general that we want to broach.
