Forum for parents for social event planning.
  (1) Awareness of general social events (low-to-high candence depending on preferences) 
  (2) Specific bi-monthly (TBD if higher frequency is preferred) social events as a group
  (3) Other social event topics of interest for broader discussion
  
  Project Tab:
  (1) allows for conversational awarness for milestones we want to achieve as a group related to social activities
  
  Issues Tab:
  (1) essentially a chat / discussion forum to enable active discussion of any thoughts related to social activity and or general that we want to broach.
